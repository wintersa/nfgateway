<h1>NForce IT - NFgateway App Development</h1>

<p>[01-02-2016]</p>
This is my development repository for creating tomcat webpackages of my Angular 2.0 websites.
The one here is a special one. The bash file creates also the app development directories for 
the NForce Gateway, also know as NFgateway. More information about the NFgateway will be published 
on the company website in the near future.
